I’m a Software Engineer specializing in API development, data management, and scalable backend architecture. I enjoy solving complex technical problems, collaborating with teams, and contributing to open-source communities.

My expertise includes building backend systems with Python (Django, FastAPI, Flask) and JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js, Express), working with SQL and NoSQL databases, and deploying applications with Docker and cloud platform (AWS). I also leverage CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Docker Hub, Terraform) as part of cloud engineering practices to enable optimized software delivery.

I explore the intersection of software engineering and AI, leveraging foundational models (LLMs) to build applications such as chatbots, automation tools, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that integrate seamlessly with modern backend services.

I actively showcase my projects on GitHub, contribute to developer resources, and am committed to building impactful solutions that benefit both businesses and the tech community.
