I’m a Software Engineer specializing in backend systems, data management, and scalable architectures. I enjoy solving complex technical problems, collaborating across teams, and contributing to open-source communities.

My expertise spans Python (Django, FastAPI, Flask) and JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js, Express), with strong experience in SQL and NoSQL databases. I deploy and manage applications using Docker, AWS, and cloud-native tools, and I integrate CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Docker Hub, Terraform) to optimize software delivery.

I also explore the intersection of software engineering and AI, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to build chatbots, automation tools, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that integrate seamlessly with backend services.

I actively showcase projects on GitHub, contribute to developer resources, and am committed to building impactful solutions for businesses and the broader tech community.
